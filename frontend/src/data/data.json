    "title": "In Search of the Magic Mushroom",
    "content": "<p>As he cast his mind back to the year 1973, remembering himself as the young PHD student full of ambition, life and experimenting with Mushrooms, Marty smiled fondly.</p><p>Between 1973 and today, Marty's life has changed dramatically. He received his PHD after creating a thesis surrounding the topic of single dose psilocybin and how this drug may substantially improve quality of life.</p><p>However, Marty couldn’t just stop there. Each day he chased his initial psychoactive experience, so he grew, developed and mutated Mushrooms in hopes of achieving that long lost initial high. Soon, Marty became known as Mad Marty from the Mushroom Farm.</p><p>Today, Mad Marty is ready to unleash his creations to the world, with some Mushrooms containing secret prizes that will only be shared with its owner.</p>"
